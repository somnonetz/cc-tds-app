# Matlab TDS

Matlab TDS is an implementation of the Time Delay Stability algorithm. It is used in sleep medicine to determine the link strength between signals in a polysomnographic recording in EDF format. The Matlab TDS software is developed at CBMI (HTW Berlin - University of Applied Sciences)

The application is written in matlab. In this branch, you get the source code, the master branch contains the application packaged as [Curious Containers](https://www.curious-containers.cc) compatible Docker image, available in the official [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/curiouscontainers/cc-tds-app/) registry.
